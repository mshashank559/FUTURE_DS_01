popular,My wife went out to lunch with a guy she met at the gym. I think this is a huge no no. AIO?,"My (39M) wife (39F) and I have been together for 14 years, married for 11. I’ve been cheated on in the past several times so I’m very sensitive to any behavior that could be construed that way.

My wife goes to the same gym 5 days a week and is always there when they open at 5am. It’s a serious thing for her. I personally go 3 days a week, but a different gym. 

Needless to say conversations have been struck up with her by various people for the last 5 years or so. One guy in particular who is divorced, and 15 years older started being friendly to her a while back (not sure how long exactly). A conversation arose about a good lunch special at a steakhouse in town and it became an ongoing thing: “You gotta try this pork chop,” etc…

Well on Friday afternoon she went to lunch with this gentlemen and then when she came home she mentioned that her leftovers were from this place and that she went with a friend. Never said anything about a work friend so I pressed a bit more for curiosity’s sake. 

She told me what happened and swore up and down nothing happened and she’s not interested in that way. 

I will say our marriage has had its ups and downs, but the ups were way higher than the downs. 

My wife has given me 0 reason in 14 years not to trust her…however the circumstances are quite suspect. 

What does everyone think?

popular,I can't help but think anyone over the age of 30 who takes the Bible seriously and makes it the foundation of their life is weak minded.,"By the time you reach 30 years old if you haven't figured out the Bible is full of shit and you still base your life around it you are absolutely a weak minded person.

The Bible is literally just some anonymous people living in the desert thousands of years ago saying crazy shit about how the world works and and how people should act. It's easy when you are young to look at the Bible as some powerful thing but if you spend a moment to think about it's just some people saying shit. 

It doesn't make you a bad person and it doesn't necessarily make you stupid but if you aren't able to free your mind from a belief so absurd by the age of 30 what else do you call someone?",8710,3186

popular,"My new boyfriend follows Andrew Tate, should I worry?","So I’ve been dating this guy (26m) for about a month now, and it’s starting to become serious between us. He is such a sweet guy, I haven’t noticed any red flags - and I’m normally very hyper vigilant to such. 

The other night we were both scrolling through reels on our phones, and I see a couple of Andrew Tate videos pop up on his for you page. So I ask him if he likes Tate, he didn’t really give a straightforward answer - but while discussing, he says something like “Tate is kinda misunderstood, and if you watch his full discussions with women etc. you would view him in a different light” 
But idk, I must confess I don’t really know that much about him, but from what I’ve heard he’s basically a walking red flag.

I know my boyfriend likes boxing, and that’s probably partly why he’s interested. 
I should also mention that my bf was raised in a female dominated home and is a little mamas boy, and loves his sisters very much too! He’s never spoken disrespectfully about any women and is very gentle and mindful of me! 

So should I be worried?

popular,AITAH FOR NOT PAYING FOR MY FRIEND'S DINNER WHEN SHE CALLED ME A PEDOPHILE,"Last time I posted on Reddit, I received some wonderful advice, and I even suggested my friend do the same. She’s using my throwaway account now.

I (29F) moved into my current apartment two years ago. We have an elderly neighbor (in her late 70s) who mostly keeps to herself. She gets her groceries and medicines delivered every week, but the newspaper delivery boy only drops the paper on the ground floor. Before I moved in, she used to pay some neighborhood kids to bring it up to her, but they moved away shortly after I arrived. So, I started bringing her the paper every day. I usually ring the bell and leave it at her door, but when the door is already open, we sometimes have a little chat. She often insists I come in for coffee and always thanks me warmly.

I noticed her apartment is filled with pictures of her grandson—probably more than 20. To be honest, I thought he was the cutest baby I’d ever seen. The photos ranged from his baby days to what looked like his 21st birthday. I assumed he was around that age but never asked, and she never mentioned it.

About a year after I moved in, I saw an incredibly attractive guy in our building. I was about 70% sure it was the same kid from the pictures, though he looked older than I expected. When he introduced himself, I found out I was right. We started talking whenever he visited his grandmother, and soon we began dating.

We’ve been together for 8 months now. He’s met my parents, and everything has been going well. Last week, I wanted him to meet my college friends and my twin sister, who’s currently in town. We all went out to dinner. Although it wasn’t explicitly discussed, it was kind of assumed that I would cover the bill—usually, when someone introduces their boyfriend to the group, the couple pays.

The dinner went really well. My friends (a group of four) and my sister all seemed genuinely happy for us. I was sharing the story of how I met him and his grandmother. At some point, my boyfriend stepped away to take a call. That’s when my friend Sara suddenly called me a pedophile.

I was honestly shocked. When I asked her if she was serious, she just said, “I know a pedophile when I see one.” I was so disturbed by her words that I excused myself. I paid the bill—except for Sara—and left with my boyfriend.

Later, she messaged me saying that besides being a pedophile, I’m also petty and cheap. It really hurt. I absolutely despise abusers, especially child abusers, so being called something like that has taken a serious emotional toll on me. I’m disgusted by her and the whole situation.

What’s been bugging me even more is that Sara was abused by a family member as a child. So now I keep questioning myself. Did I do something wrong?

My sister and two of my friends are standing by me. Another friend said she doesn’t think I’m a pedophile, but she finds it “a bit creepy” that I saw him as a baby before we met.

My boyfriend (30M) actually found it funny at first, but after seeing how upset I’ve been, he’s been reassuring me and telling me it’s not weird at all.

I don’t know what to do. I know I’m not a pedophile, but it’s been really upsetting to be seen as one by someone I once trusted.

English is not my first language so  pardon me for any mistakes

popular,"Euch ist nicht klar, wie viel eures Geld wirklich an die alte Generation fließt.","Letztens kam mir ein Gedanke: Als arbeitende Bevölkerung zahlen wir nicht nur Rentenversicherungsbeiträge für die ältere Generation. In Deutschland fließt noch viel mehr unserer Produktivität an Rentner. Weil mich das am Wochenende beschäftigt hat, habe ich eine einfache Website erstellt, auf der ihr sehen könnt, wie viel eures Gehalts an die ältere Generation geht: https://rentner.pages.dev/ . (Und ihr könnt sogar eine Urkunde ausdrucken! :D)
Folgendes wird oft übersehen:

- Die Krankenkasse funktioniert in Deutschland ebenfalls als Umlageverfahren, und bereits heute fließen 51,4 % der Ausgaben an Menschen über 65.
- Die Pflegeversicherung.
- Ein großer Teil eurer Steuern im Bundeshaushalt (ca. 20 %) wird als Zuschuss für die Rentenversicherung verwendet.
- Mit euren Steuern werden auch Pensionen finanziert. 2023 beliefen sich die Ausgaben des Staates für Pensionen, Hinterbliebenenversorgung und Beihilfen auf rund 85,9 Milliarden Euro.
- 8,2 % des GEZ-Beitrags gehen für Betriebsrenten drauf.

Ich weiß, es fehlt noch einiges (z. B. Kapitalerträge, Umsatzsteuer) und manches ist vereinfacht (z. B. Steuerklassen). Ja, das bezieht den Arbeitgeberanteil mit ein. Trotzdem soll es euch sensibilisieren: Das System ist jetzt schon grenzwertig und wird mit jedem Jahr kritischer.

Und jetzt das Interessante: Die arbeitende Bevölkerung scheint das gar nicht ändern zu wollen. Bei der letzten Bundestagswahl hat die Linke bei jungen Wählern den ersten Platz geholt. Die Linke will die Renten erhöhen, eine Mindestrente einführen, die über dem heutigen Durchschnitt liegt, und das Renteneintrittsalter senken.

Tolle Ausgangslage. Aber ich hänge mir jetzt erst mal eine Urkunde an die Wand.",2189,1138

popular,AITA for telling my husband I’ll divorce him if he doesn’t agree to a fertility test?,"My husband and I have been married for a year now. Everything seemed fine until around the third month of our marriage when he suddenly woke me up in the middle of the night to say he wanted us to adopt a child. I was shocked — it felt so sudden and out of nowhere. I asked him why, and he said he just didn’t want to deal with the stress of pregnancy and childbirth.

I was confused, but I calmly told him that I would be the one carrying the child, not him. All I needed was his support, and that I was okay with going through pregnancy. He didn’t like that response, but we let the topic go that night.

Months later, he brought it up again — more insistent this time, still giving the same reason. I started to feel something was off. As time went on, his behavior began to change. He became distant, cold, and just... not himself. Every time I tried to talk to him, the conversation circled back to adopting a child.

Then he pointed out it had been 8 months and I haven't gotten pregnant yet. I suggested we both get tested to check our fertility — he flat-out refused. I went alone and got checked, and my doctor told me everything looked fine with me. I brought the test results home, hoping it would bring some relief, but he barely looked at them. No reaction. No support. No relief.

I asked him again to please go for a test himself so we could move forward together, and he completely refused. He still keeps saying he just wants us to adopt. At this point, I feel like I’m living with a stranger. He avoids emotional conversations, barely talks to me, and the warmth in our home is gone.

Last week, I told him directly that I couldn’t keep living like this, and if he wouldn’t agree to at least get tested, I would file for divorce. Later that evening, his best friend showed up, and after talking with my husband, he pulled me aside and asked if I wasn’t being too unreasonable by bringing up divorce over something like this.

So... AITA for standing my ground and threatening divorce over this?",1579,608

I have a relative like this who is 38 and has never worked a job. He says jobs won’t pay him what he’s worth, and he is above work. So he spends all of his time playing PC games on the internet and pretending to be an 18 year old. He will not lift a finger to clean up after himself. He is for sure an internet addict.

If you even hint at him trying to look for a job he flies into screaming, murderous rages. His poor dad is old with serious health issues and cannot retire because of so many expenses his son incurred.

Obviously there was family dysfunction where the mom coddled and protected her son far too much, did his homework, etc, but now they are kind of stuck. If they try to pull all support he will definitely just kill himself. No doubt about it. The dad feels that since they created this monster it’s their cross to bear.

Anyone know anyone else like this or is this the worst case of manchild you’ve heard of? It’s actually even worse but I won’t get into it…

fitness,New to r/Fitness? CLICK HERE FIRST!,"# Welcome to r/Fitness - Reddit's #1 Health and Fitness community!

r/Fitness is a **self-help** community.  Before asking questions, you are expected to have made a good faith effort to find an answer on your own and show it by explaining where you looked, what you found, and why it wasn't enough.  We ask you to respect that the people answering your questions are volunteering their time, knowledge, and experience.

To help answer your questions, get you started, or help you continue on your fitness journey, we have complied a comprehensive Wiki and FAQ.  [**https://thefitness.wiki/**](https://thefitness.wiki/) is the result of community discussions on best practice, expert opinion, emerging science, and general know-how from those who have made fitness their lifestyle or profession.

# The r/Fitness wiki is moderator funded.

Domain registration and hosting costs over $500 per year, but it is important to us to house this resource off-platform.  Why?  To keep it ad-free and prevent any undue sponsorship or marketing influence, to keep it free and accessible to all despite any site changes, to keep it organized, to ensure content and links to outside resources work regardless of app or browser, to enable proper search functionality, and to make sure it's available during site outages.

# Resources - Check these for answers before posting a question!

* [The r/Fitness Wiki and FAQ.](https://thefitness.wiki/)  Most questions that people come to r/Fitness with can be answered directly by the Wiki and FAQ or by applying the information found in it.  It will always be the best first place to look for answers.  Moderators or the community can help direct you to the right information if you have trouble finding it.
* [Searching past threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/search?q=&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all)  r/Fitness has over a decade of discussion threads that are very likely to have answers to your questions if our Wiki and FAQ does not.  Remember when searching that fitness and exercise are not fast moving topics, and even discussions that are several years old are going to be relevant today.
* [Google.](https://www.google.com/)  Yes, really, or your preferred search engine.  Google excels at being a source of answers for common fitness and exercise questions including exercise alternatives or progressions, meal plan and food options, equipment or product reviews, and so on.
* Yourself.  Many questions we see come down to a matter of personal preference or can be answered by ""it depends.""  You should check in with yourself before asking the community to decide something for you.

# The Rules

[The rules for r/Fitness can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules)

r/Fitness is a high traffic community that is heavily moderated to maintain quality control and make good use of the resources provided.  When making a post or comment, you are expected to understand and abide by our rules.  Make sure to review [Rule #0 - No Threads That Are Answered by the Wiki, Searching Threads, or Google](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules/rule0) and [Rule #5 - No Questions Related to Injury, Pain, or Any Medical Topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules/rule5) as these are the two most commonly broken rules by new users.

What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).
